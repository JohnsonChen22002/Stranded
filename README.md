user inputs
1) Vehicle type
2) Energy Type
3) Energy Amount

using the vehicle type and a hardcoded object, we find the weight
using the energy type, we determine the units
using the energy type and energy amount, we find the
total energy produced

distance = Energy produced / vehicle weight
calculate distance from that formula
